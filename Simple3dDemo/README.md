## J2me Simple 3D demo 


This midlet is developed in 2007. It is not entirely successful outcome of attempts to create a simple library for creating J2me applications with 3D graphics that can run on devices without OpenGL support. 
In 2007 I had the idea to create a few simple games for mobile phones. Unfortunately the performance of the library was too low for such a great purpose.
Low consumption of memory is feature of the library but it is not productive enough.
There are the library of 3D-primitives and a demo program that uses it to create simplest 3D scenes in the project.
The application does not use nearly J2me. The sole function of the MIDlet is to render the content of a bitmap that generates 3D library written in Java.

The app is suitable for mobile phones that support CLDC1.1 and MIDP2.0 specifications.
